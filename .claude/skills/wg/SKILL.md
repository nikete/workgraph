# workgraph

## First: orient and start the service

At the start of every session, run these two commands:

```bash
wg quickstart              # Orient yourself — prints cheat sheet and service status
wg service start           # Start the coordinator (no-op if already running)
```

If the service is already running, `wg service start` will tell you. Always ensure the service is up before defining work — it's what dispatches tasks to agents.

## Your role as a top-level agent

You are a **coordinator**. Your job is to define work and let the service dispatch it.

### Start the service if it's not running

```bash
wg service start --max-agents 5
```

### Define tasks with dependencies

```bash
wg add "Design the API" --description "Description of what to do"
wg add "Implement backend" --blocked-by design-the-api
wg add "Write tests" --blocked-by implement-backend
```

### Monitor progress

```bash
wg list                  # All tasks with status
wg list --status open    # Filter by status (open, in-progress, done, failed)
wg agents                # Who's working on what
wg agents --alive        # Only alive agents
wg agents --working      # Only working agents
wg service status        # Service health
wg status                # Quick one-screen overview
wg viz                   # ASCII dependency graph
wg tui                   # Interactive TUI dashboard
```

### What you do NOT do as coordinator

- **Don't `wg claim`** — the service claims tasks automatically
- **Don't `wg spawn`** — the service spawns agents automatically
- **Don't work on tasks yourself** — spawned agents do the work

Always use `wg done` to complete tasks. Do NOT use `wg submit` (deprecated).

## If you ARE a spawned agent working on a task

You were spawned by the service to work on a specific task. Your workflow:

```bash
wg show <task-id>        # Understand what to do
wg context <task-id>     # See inputs from dependencies
wg log <task-id> "msg"   # Log progress as you work
wg done <task-id>        # Mark complete when finished
```

If you discover new work while working:

```bash
wg add "New task" --blocked-by <current-task>
```

Record output files so downstream tasks can find them:

```bash
wg artifact <task-id> path/to/output
```

## Manual mode (no service running)

Only use this if you're working alone without the service:

```bash
wg ready                 # See available tasks
wg claim <task-id>       # Claim a task
wg log <task-id> "msg"   # Log progress
wg done <task-id>        # Mark complete
```

## Task lifecycle

```
open → [claim] → in-progress → [done] → done
                              → [fail] → failed → [retry] → open
                              → [abandon] → abandoned
```

**Note:** `wg submit`, `wg approve`, and `wg reject` are deprecated. Always use `wg done`.

## Loop edges (cyclic processes)

Some workflows repeat. A `loops_to` edge on a task fires when that task completes, resetting a target task back to `open` and incrementing its `loop_iteration`. Intermediate tasks in the dependency chain are also re-opened automatically.

```bash
# Create: revise loops back to write, max 3 iterations
wg add "Revise" --blocked-by review --loops-to write --loop-max 3

# Self-loops, delays, and guards
wg add "Poll" --loops-to poll --loop-max 10 --loop-delay 5m
wg add "Retry" --loops-to retry --loop-max 5 --loop-guard "task:conn-check=done"
```

As a spawned agent on a looping task, check `wg show <task-id>` for `loop_iteration` to know which pass you're on. Review previous logs and artifacts to build on prior work.

```bash
wg loops                    # List all loop edges and status
wg show <task-id>           # See loop_iteration and loop edges
```

### Pausing and resuming loops

To temporarily stop a looping task without losing its iteration count or loop edges:

```bash
wg pause <task-id>          # Coordinator skips this task until resumed
wg resume <task-id>         # Task becomes dispatchable again
```

Paused tasks keep their status, loop edges, and iteration count intact. `wg show` displays "(PAUSED)" and `wg list` shows "[PAUSED]".

To pause/resume the entire coordinator (all dispatching stops, running agents continue):

```bash
wg service pause            # No new agents spawned
wg service resume           # Resume dispatching
```

## Executor and model awareness

### Environment variables

Every spawned agent receives these environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `WG_TASK_ID` | The task ID you're working on |
| `WG_AGENT_ID` | Your agent ID |
| `WG_EXECUTOR_TYPE` | Executor type: `claude`, `amplifier`, or `shell` |
| `WG_MODEL` | Model you're running on (e.g. `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) — set when a model is configured |

### Multi-executor awareness

You may be running under different executors:

- **claude** — Claude Code CLI (`claude --print`). You have full access to Claude Code tools (file editing, bash, etc).
- **amplifier** — Amplifier multi-agent runtime. You have access to installed amplifier bundles and can delegate to sub-agents.
- **shell** — Direct shell execution for scripted tasks.

Check `$WG_EXECUTOR_TYPE` to know which executor you're running under if your behavior should differ.

### Model awareness

The `$WG_MODEL` variable tells you what model you're running on. Different tasks may use different models based on complexity (model hierarchy: task.model > executor.model > coordinator.model).

Calibrate your approach to your model tier:
- **Frontier models** (opus): Tackle complex multi-file refactors, architectural decisions, nuanced trade-offs.
- **Mid-tier models** (sonnet): Good for standard implementation, bug fixes, well-scoped features.
- **Fast models** (haiku): Best for simple, well-defined tasks — lookups, single-file edits, formatting.

If a task feels beyond your model's capability, use `wg fail` with a clear reason rather than producing low-quality output.

### Amplifier bundles (amplifier executor only)

When running under the amplifier executor (`WG_EXECUTOR_TYPE=amplifier`), you can use installed amplifier bundles for specialized capabilities. Delegate to sub-agents when:

- The subtask is independent and well-scoped (e.g. "write tests for module X")
- Parallel execution would speed things up
- The subtask needs a different skill set than your current context

Do the work yourself when:
- The task is simple and sequential
- Context from prior steps is critical and hard to transfer
- Coordination overhead would exceed the work itself
