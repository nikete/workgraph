# workgraph

Structured task coordination for complex work. Use this when you need to break down, track, and execute multi-step projects.

## When to use workgraph

- Projects with multiple dependent tasks
- Work that spans multiple sessions
- Coordinating between humans and AI agents
- Anything where you need to track "what's done, what's next, what's blocked"

## Quick check

```bash
wg ready    # what can I work on?
wg list     # all tasks
wg analyze  # project health
```

## The protocol

### Starting work

1. Check what's available:
   ```bash
   wg ready
   ```

2. Claim a task:
   ```bash
   wg claim <task-id> --actor claude
   ```

3. Understand the task:
   ```bash
   wg show <task-id>      # full details
   wg context <task-id>   # inputs from dependencies
   ```

### While working

Log progress (helps with context recovery if interrupted):
```bash
wg log <task-id> "Completed X, now working on Y"
```

If you produce output files:
```bash
wg artifact <task-id> path/to/output
```

### Finishing

Success:
```bash
wg done <task-id>
```

Failed (can retry later):
```bash
wg fail <task-id> --reason "why it failed"
```

Need to stop mid-task:
```bash
wg unclaim <task-id>
```

### Discovering new work

Add tasks as you discover them:
```bash
wg add "New task title" --blocked-by current-task
```

Check impact:
```bash
wg impact <task-id>  # what depends on this?
```

## Planning work

Break down a goal:
```bash
wg add "Goal: Ship the feature"
wg add "Design the API"
wg add "Implement backend" --blocked-by design-the-api
wg add "Write tests" --blocked-by implement-backend
wg add "Update docs" --blocked-by implement-backend
```

Add metadata:
```bash
wg add "Complex task" \
  --hours 4 \
  --skill rust \
  --deliverable src/feature.rs \
  --blocked-by prerequisite-task
```

Check the plan:
```bash
wg critical-path  # longest chain
wg bottlenecks    # what to prioritize
wg forecast       # when will it be done?
```

## Analysis commands

| Command | What it tells you |
|---------|-------------------|
| `wg ready` | Tasks you can work on now |
| `wg list` | All tasks with status |
| `wg show <id>` | Full task details |
| `wg why-blocked <id>` | Why can't this start? |
| `wg impact <id>` | What depends on this? |
| `wg bottlenecks` | Highest-impact tasks |
| `wg critical-path` | Longest dependency chain |
| `wg forecast` | Completion estimate |
| `wg analyze` | Full health report |
| `wg context <id>` | Available inputs |
| `wg trajectory <id>` | Optimal claim order |

## Key behaviors

1. **Always claim before working** - prevents conflicts with other agents
2. **Log as you go** - helps recovery if interrupted
3. **Mark done immediately** - unblocks dependent tasks
4. **Add tasks as you discover them** - keep the graph current
5. **Check `wg ready` after completing** - see what's unblocked

## Multi-agent coordination

If multiple agents are working:
- Claims are atomic (no double-work)
- Use `wg coordinate` to see parallel opportunities
- Each agent should have a unique actor ID

## Agent Service

Automated agent spawning and management for parallel task execution.

### When to use spawn vs manual claim

Use `wg spawn` when:
- Running multiple agents in parallel
- Need automatic output capture
- Want heartbeat monitoring and dead agent detection
- Automating a coordinator pattern

Use manual `wg claim` when:
- Working interactively on a single task
- Don't need process management
- Testing or debugging

### Spawning agents

```bash
wg spawn <task-id> --executor <name> [--timeout <duration>]
```

Spawns an agent process to work on a task:
1. Claims the task (fails if already claimed)
2. Loads executor config from `.workgraph/executors/<name>.toml`
3. Starts the executor process with task context
4. Registers agent in the registry
5. Returns immediately (doesn't wait for completion)

```bash
wg spawn implement-feature --executor claude
# Spawned agent-7 for task 'implement-feature'
#   Executor: claude
#   PID: 54321
#   Output: .workgraph/agents/agent-7/output.log
```

### Monitoring agents

```bash
wg agents                # List all agents
wg agents --alive        # Only running agents
wg agents --dead         # Only dead agents
wg agents --working      # Actively working
wg agents --idle         # Idle agents
wg agents --json         # JSON for scripting
```

Output shows agent ID, task, executor, PID, uptime, and status.

### Terminating agents

```bash
wg kill <agent-id>       # Graceful (SIGTERM, wait, SIGKILL)
wg kill <agent-id> --force  # Immediate SIGKILL
wg kill --all            # Kill all running agents
```

Killing an agent automatically unclaims its task.

### Dead agent detection

Agents send heartbeats. When heartbeats stop, agents are marked dead.

```bash
wg dead-agents --check              # Check for dead agents (read-only)
wg dead-agents --cleanup            # Mark dead and unclaim their tasks
wg dead-agents --remove             # Remove dead agents from registry
wg dead-agents --threshold 10       # Custom timeout in minutes
```

### Service daemon

Optional background daemon for centralized agent management:

```bash
wg service start         # Start daemon
wg service stop          # Stop daemon
wg service stop --force  # Stop and kill all agents
wg service status        # Show daemon status and agent summary
```

The daemon:
- Accepts spawn requests via Unix socket
- Monitors agent health periodically
- Automatically detects dead agents

### Executor configuration

Executors define how agents run. Place configs in `.workgraph/executors/`:

**Claude executor** (`claude.toml`):
```toml
[executor]
type = "claude"
command = "claude"
args = ["--print", "--dangerously-skip-permissions"]

[executor.prompt_template]
template = """
Working on: {{task_id}} - {{task_title}}
{{task_description}}

Context: {{task_context}}

When done: wg done {{task_id}}
"""
```

**Shell executor** (`shell.toml`) - uses task's `exec` field:
```toml
[executor]
type = "shell"
command = "bash"
```

### Coordinator pattern

Automate parallel task execution:

```bash
while true; do
    READY=$(wg ready --json | jq -r '.[].id')
    [ -z "$READY" ] && { sleep 10; continue; }

    for TASK in $READY; do
        wg spawn "$TASK" --executor claude
    done
    sleep 30
done
```

## All commands

wg init              # start a workgraph
wg add <title>       # create task
wg done <id>         # complete task
