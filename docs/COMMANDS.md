### `wg done`

Mark a task as completed.

```

Sets status to `done`, records `completed_at` timestamp, and unblocks dependent tasks. Fails for verified tasks (use `wg submit` instead).

```bash
wg done design-api
# Automatically unblocks tasks that were waiting on design-api
```

---

### `wg submit`

Submit a verified task for review.

```bash
wg submit <ID> [--actor <ACTOR>]
```

Sets status to `pending-review`. Used for tasks created with `--verify` that require approval before completion.

**Example:**
```bash
wg submit security-audit --actor claude
```

---

### `wg approve`

Approve a pending-review task (marks as done).

```bash
wg approve <ID> [--actor <ACTOR>]
```

**Example:**
```bash
wg approve security-audit --actor erik
```

---

### `wg reject`

Reject a pending-review task (returns to open for rework).

```bash
wg reject <ID> [--reason <TEXT>] [--actor <ACTOR>]
```

**Example:**
```bash
wg reject security-audit --reason "Missing OWASP top 10 coverage" --actor erik
```

---

### `wg fail`

```bash
wg abandon legacy-migration --reason "Feature deprecated"
```

---

### `wg retry`

Reset a failed task back to open status for another attempt.

```bash
wg retry <ID>

Increments the retry counter and sets status back to `open`.

**Example:**
```bash
wg retry deploy-prod
# Resets deploy-prod to open status with incremented retry count
```

Claiming sets `started_at` timestamp and assigns the task. Prevents double-work in multi-agent scenarios.

**Example:**
```bash
wg claim implement-api --actor claude
```

---

### `wg unclaim`

Release a claimed task back to open status.

```bash
wg unclaim <ID>
```

**Example:**
```bash
wg unclaim implement-api
# Returns the task to open status so another agent can pick it up

```

---

### `wg log`

Add progress notes to a task or view existing logs.

```bash
# Add a log entry
wg log <ID> <MESSAGE> [--actor <ACTOR>]

# View log entries
wg log <ID> --list
```

**Examples:**
```bash
wg log implement-api "Completed endpoint handlers" --actor erik
wg log implement-api --list
```

---

### `wg assign`

Assign an agent identity to a task (or clear the assignment).

```bash
wg assign <TASK> <AGENT-HASH>    # Assign agent to task
wg assign <TASK> --clear         # Remove assignment
```

When the service spawns that task, the agent's role and motivation are injected into the prompt. The agent hash can be a prefix (minimum 4 characters).

```bash
wg assign my-task a3f7c21d
wg assign my-task --clear
```
