# Workgraph Code Review Synthesis

> **Note:** This document synthesizes findings from a Feb 11, 2026 code review. Detailed review documents have been archived to `docs/archive/reviews/`. Some recommendations may be partially completed or outdated. Use the Top 10 Recommendations section below as a prioritized action list.

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Source:** 10 review documents covering the full codebase
**Scope:** 92 source files (~45,800 lines), 9 test files (~7,650 lines), 67 CLI commands

## 1. Executive Summary

Workgraph is a well-engineered task graph coordinator with a clean core and ambitious feature set. The foundational layer — graph model, parser, query engine, validation — is solid at ~2,100 lines with good test coverage and few issues. The service daemon with IPC-based coordination is architecturally sound. The identity system (roles/objectives/agents) is the most thoroughly tested subsystem.

**However, the codebase has grown organically to ~45,800 lines and shows signs of accumulated tech debt:**

- **Significant code duplication** — `make_task` (duplicated 22+ times), `build_reverse_index` (6 times), `spawn.rs` run/spawn_agent (~250 duplicate lines), Matrix command parser (full copy-paste between features), and more. Conservatively **1,500–2,000 lines** of pure duplication.
- **Dead and vestigial code** — The `Executor` trait is never used in production, `src/executors/` is dead re-exports, `petgraph` dependency is unused, 4 of 7 `AgentStatus` variants are never set, the old `wg agent` loop coexists with the service daemon without clear demarcation.
- **Test coverage is deeply uneven** — The identity system has ~3,850 lines of excellent tests, but CLI commands (~23,000 lines), TUI (~4,362 lines), Matrix integration (~2,787 lines), and the evolution module (~2,677 lines) have **zero** test coverage. Only 1 of 9 integration test files runs in CI.
- **Documentation is stale** — COMMANDS.md documents ~35 of 67 commands. AGENT-SERVICE.md describes a design that doesn't match the implementation. The README is missing significant features (edit, submit/approve/reject, status, dag).
- **Architectural redundancy** — Two identity systems (Actor vs Agent), two prompt/executor systems (Executor trait vs spawn.rs), two Matrix implementations sharing copy-pasted code.

**Overall codebase health: 6.5/10** — Strong fundamentals, but debt is accumulating faster than it's being paid down. The next phase of work should focus on consolidation over new features.

## 2. Top 10 Recommendations (Ranked by Impact vs Effort)

| # | Recommendation | Value | Effort | Source Review |
|---|---------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **1** | **Extract shared test helpers** (`make_task`, `wg_cmd`, `wait_for`, `build_reverse_index`) into common modules | High — eliminates ~1,000+ lines of duplication, makes adding tests easier | Low — mechanical extraction | Analysis, Tests, Core |
| **2** | **Fix failing CI** — update stale test assertions in `config.rs` (`"opus-4-5"` → `"opus"`), add remaining 8 integration test files to CI | High — CI is currently red; 8/9 test files never run in CI | Low — trivial assertion fix + CI config | Config/Build |
| **3** | **Deduplicate `spawn.rs`** — extract `spawn_inner()` shared by `run()` and `spawn_agent()` | High — eliminates ~250 lines of the highest-risk duplication (bug fixes must be applied twice) | Low-Med — both functions are structurally similar | Service Layer |
| **4** | **Remove `blocks` field from Task** — compute on demand from `blocked_by` | High — eliminates the biggest data integrity hazard in the core engine (unsynchronized dual representation) | Low — `blocks` is only used in 3 visualization commands | Core Graph |
| **5** | **Consolidate Matrix code** — extract shared command parser and executor into `matrix_common` | High — eliminates ~560 lines of copy-paste; fixes zero-test coverage on lite commands | Med — requires careful `#[cfg]` wiring | Matrix |
| **6** | **Add `Task::new(id, title)` constructor with defaults** | Med — eliminates 22+ duplicated `make_task` helpers, makes 28-field struct manageable | Low — simple constructor + Default impl | Core Graph |
| **7** | **Resolve Executor trait question** — either use it in production or remove it (+ `src/executors/` dead code) | Med — removes confusion about where spawning logic lives; ~1,500 lines clarified or deleted | Med — requires deciding the target architecture | Service Layer |
| **8** | **Reduce graph loads in `coordinator_tick()`** — load once, pass `&mut WorkGraph`, save once | Med — eliminates up to 5 redundant graph loads per tick; closes TOCTOU windows | Med — requires refactoring 300-line function | Service Layer |
| **9** | **Update COMMANDS.md** — add ~30 missing commands, fix stale entries | High for adoption — the command reference is at 50% accuracy | Med — significant writing effort | Documentation |
| **10** | **Merge redundant analysis commands** — fold `bottlenecks` and `structure` into `analyze` | Med — reduces command count, eliminates duplicated computation | Low-Med — `analyze` already has equivalent sections | Analysis |

| Deprecate standalone `wg agent` loop in favor of `wg service start` | Removes user confusion about which system to use |
| Clarify Actor (graph node) vs Agent (identity entity) — deprecate one | Removes overlapping identity systems |
| Merge `bottlenecks` + `structure` into `analyze`; consider `aging` + `workload` | Net -700 to -2,100 lines |
| Clean up unused AgentStatus variants (Starting, Idle, Done, Failed) | Simplifies state machine |
| Gate `tokio` behind matrix features | Faster builds for non-Matrix users |

### Phase 4: Documentation & Testing (ongoing)

| Add `wg evolve` unit tests (mutation, crossover, tournament) | Covers highest-risk untested code (2,677 lines) |
| Add CLI smoke tests (--help on all commands) | Catches argument parsing regressions |
| Add Matrix feature CI build | Prevents silent breakage of feature-gated code |
| Atomic file writes in `save_graph` (temp + rename) | Prevents data loss on crash |

## 4. Architectural Concerns & Tech Debt Hotspots

### 4.1 Hotspot: `src/commands/service.rs` (2,293 lines)

The daemon/coordinator module is the complexity center of the codebase. `coordinator_tick()` alone is 300+ lines doing 7 distinct things. It loads the graph up to 5 times per tick. The auto-assign and auto-reward blocks are 90-120 lines each, embedded inline. This is the most fragile code path — any bug here affects all agent coordination.

**Risk:** High. Changes to coordinator logic are error-prone due to the function's length and the repeated graph load/save pattern.

### 4.2 Hotspot: `src/commands/spawn.rs` (998 lines)

Contains two nearly-identical 260-line functions (`run()` and `spawn_agent()`). Any fix to agent spawning must be manually applied to both. The wrapper script generation (bash that pipes prompts, checks status via `grep -o` JSON parsing) is fragile.

**Risk:** High. The duplication is a maintenance timebomb — divergence between the two paths will cause subtle bugs.

### 4.3 Hotspot: `src/main.rs` (2,014 lines)

67-variant `Commands` enum with ~780 lines of argument definitions. The 535-line `main()` dispatch function and 72-line manual `command_name()` mapping must be updated in lockstep when commands change. The `Config` command alone has 28 fields.

**Risk:** Medium. Adding new commands requires touching 3-4 places in main.rs. Not architecturally dangerous but a significant maintenance friction.

### 4.4 Concern: Two Spawning/Executor Systems

The `Executor` trait (`src/service/executor.rs`, `claude.rs`, `shell.rs` — ~2,068 lines) defines a clean abstraction for agent spawning. But the production coordinator doesn't use it — `spawn.rs` reimplements everything from scratch. The `Executor::spawn()` method is dead code. This is ~1,500 lines of infrastructure that doesn't serve its intended purpose.

### 4.5 Concern: Two Identity Systems

`Actor` (graph.rs) and `Agent` (identity.rs) both model "who does work" with overlapping fields (capabilities/skills, assignment). The `Actor` system is used by `wg match` and `wg next`; the `Agent` system is used by `wg assign`, identity prompts, and rewards. Users must understand both to use the system effectively.

### 4.6 Concern: Speculative Complexity in Evolution

The evolution system (`src/commands/evolve.rs` — 2,677 lines) implements mutation, crossover, tournament selection, and population management. It requires accumulated reward data to be useful. Combined with identity stats (675 lines) and lineage tracking, this is ~3,350 lines of infrastructure for a feature that only becomes valuable after many reward cycles — a threshold most projects won't reach. The code has **zero test coverage**.

### 4.7 Concern: Test Coverage Cliff

The test suite has a dramatic gap: the identity data model is tested at ~3,850 lines (excellent), but **~30,000 lines of CLI commands, TUI, Matrix, and evolution code have no tests**. Only 1 of 9 integration test files runs in CI. Two unit tests are currently failing (stale assertions).

### 4.8 Concern: Data Integrity

- `blocks` and `blocked_by` are unsynchronized dual representations — no code enforces consistency.
- `save_graph` truncates and rewrites the file under lock — a crash mid-write loses data (no atomic rename).
- Matrix listeners bypass `flock`-based graph locking — concurrent Matrix and CLI modifications can corrupt the graph.
- `unclaim` can reset a Done task to Open with no guard — likely a bug.

## 5. Prioritized Action Plan

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Fix CI** — Update `config.rs` test assertions, add all integration test files to CI workflow.
2. **Remove dead code** — `src/executors/`, unused `petgraph`, duplicate `libc` entry, Matrix dead code.
3. **Fix `unclaim` bug** — Reject unclaim on Done/Abandoned tasks.

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

4. **Extract shared test helpers** — `tests/common/mod.rs` with `make_task`, `wg_cmd`, `wait_for`, etc.
5. **Deduplicate `spawn.rs`** — Extract `spawn_inner()`.
6. **Consolidate Matrix shared code** — Single command parser, single executor, add graph locking.
7. **Add `Task::new()` constructor** — Eliminate test helper duplication.
8. **Add log entries to all state transitions** — `done`, `fail`, `abandon`, `retry`, `claim`, `unclaim` should all log.

### Medium-Term (Next Month)

9. **Remove `blocks` field** — Compute on demand from `blocked_by`.
10. **Resolve Executor trait** — Either integrate into spawn path or remove.
11. **Refactor `coordinator_tick()`** — Single graph load, extracted sub-functions.
12. **Atomic file writes in `save_graph`** — Temp file + rename pattern.
13. **Update COMMANDS.md** — Add all 30+ missing commands.
14. **Update README** — Add edit, submit/approve/reject, status, dag, link IDENTITY.md.
15. **Add `wg evolve` tests** — At minimum: mutation, crossover, tournament selection unit tests.

### Long-Term (Next Quarter)

16. **Merge redundant analysis commands** into `analyze`.
17. **Deprecate `wg agent` standalone loop** — Consolidate on service daemon.
18. **Clarify Actor vs Agent** — Deprecate Actor system or document separation clearly.
19. **Split `main.rs`** — Move subcommand enums into modules, extract help system.
20. **Typed timestamps** — `Option<DateTime<Utc>>` instead of `Option<String>`.
21. **Add CLI smoke tests** — Run `--help` on all 67 commands.
22. **Archive stale docs** — Move resolved design docs to `docs/archive/`.
23. **Migrate `serde_yaml` to `serde_yml`** — Deprecated crate.
