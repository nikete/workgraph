**Task**: research-org-patterns
**Audience**: Workgraph users designing agencies, roles, and task decompositions

---

## Executive Summary

Workgraph's primitives — tasks, dependency edges, roles, motivations, agents, a coordinator, evaluations, and an evolve loop — are not arbitrary design choices. They map precisely onto well-established concepts from organizational theory, cybernetics, workflow science, and distributed systems. This document develops a vocabulary and framework — a "mathematics of organizations" — that helps users think rigorously about how to structure work in workgraph.

**Key findings:**

1. **The task graph is a stigmergic medium.** Agents coordinate indirectly by reading and writing task state, exactly as ants coordinate via pheromone trails. No agent-to-agent communication is needed — the graph *is* the communication channel.

2. **`blocked_by` edges natively express the five basic workflow patterns** (Sequence, Parallel Split, Synchronization, Exclusive Choice, Simple Merge). `loops_to` back-edges add structured loops and arbitrary cycles. Advanced patterns (discriminators, cancellation, milestones) require coordinator logic.

3. **The execute→evaluate→evolve loop is autopoietic.** The system literally produces the components (agent definitions) that produce the system (task completions that trigger evaluations that trigger evolution). This is Maturana & Varela's self-producing network, Luhmann's operationally closed social system, and Argyris & Schön's double-loop learning — all at once.

4. **Fork-Join is the natural topology of `blocked_by` graphs.** The planner→N workers→synthesizer pattern is workgraph's most fundamental parallel decomposition. It maps to MapReduce, scatter-gather, and WCP2+WCP3.

5. **The coordinator is a cybernetic regulator** operating an OODA loop, subject to Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety: the number of distinct roles must match or exceed the variety of task types, or the system becomes under-regulated.

6. **Evaluations solve the principal-agent problem.** The human principal delegates to autonomous agents under information asymmetry. Evaluations are the monitoring mechanism; motivations are the bonding mechanism; evolution is the incentive-alignment mechanism.

7. **Role design is an Inverse Conway Maneuver.** Conway's Law predicts that system architecture mirrors org structure. In workgraph, deliberately designing roles shapes the task decomposition and therefore the output architecture.

## 1. Stigmergy: The Task Graph as Coordination Medium

### 1.1 What is Stigmergy?

Stigmergy (from Greek *stigma* "mark" + *ergon* "work") is indirect coordination between agents through traces left in a shared environment. The term was coined by Pierre-Paul Grassé in 1959 to explain how termites coordinate mound construction without a central plan: each termite reads the current state of the structure and responds with an action that modifies that structure, which in turn stimulates further action by other termites.

As Heylighen (2016) defines it: "A process is stigmergic if the work done by one agent provides a stimulus that entices other agents to continue the job."

There are two fundamental types:

| Type | Definition | Example | Persistence |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Sematectonic** | The work product itself serves as the stimulus | Termite mounds: the shape of the partial structure tells the next termite what to do | Permanent (structural) |
| **Marker-based** | A separate signal (marker) is deposited, distinct from the work product | Ant pheromone trails: the chemical trail is not the food, but a signal about the food | Transient (decays) |

### 1.2 Workgraph is a Stigmergic System

A workgraph task graph is a stigmergic medium. Agents do not communicate with each other directly — they read and write to the shared graph, and the graph's state stimulates their actions.

| Stigmergy Concept | Workgraph Equivalent |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Shared environment** | The task graph (`.workgraph/graph.jsonl`) |
| **Sematectonic trace** | A completed task's artifacts — the code, docs, or other work product left behind *is* the stimulus for downstream tasks |
| **Marker-based trace** | Task status changes (`Open`→`Done`, `Failed`), dependency edges, evaluation scores |
| **Pheromone decay** | Stale assignment detection (dead agent checks), task expiration |
| **Stigmergic coordination** | The coordinator polls the graph for "ready" tasks (all `blocked_by` satisfied) — it reads the markers |
| **Self-reinforcing trails** | Tasks with good evaluation scores reinforce the role/motivation patterns that produced them (via evolve) |

This is not a metaphor. It is a precise structural correspondence. The defining characteristic of stigmergy — that agents coordinate through a shared medium rather than through direct communication — is exactly how workgraph agents operate. Agent A completes task X, modifying the graph (setting status to `Done`, recording artifacts). Agent B, working on task Y with `blocked_by = [X]`, is now unblocked. B never spoke to A. The graph mediated the coordination.

### 1.3 Real-World Stigmergic Systems

Wikipedia is the canonical human example of stigmergy. An editor sees a stub article (the trace), is stimulated to expand it, and leaves a more complete article (a new trace) that stimulates further refinement. Open-source development works identically: a bug report (marker) stimulates a patch (sematectonic), which stimulates a review (marker), which stimulates a merge (sematectonic).

The theoretical literature connects stigmergy to self-organization, emergence, and scalability. Stigmergic systems scale better than centrally planned systems because adding agents does not increase communication overhead — the coordination cost is absorbed by the shared medium.

### 1.4 Implications for Workgraph Users

- **The task graph is your communication channel.** Write descriptive task titles, clear descriptions, and meaningful log entries — these are the "pheromone trails" that guide downstream agents.
- **Task decomposition is environment design.** How you break work into tasks determines the stigmergic landscape agents navigate. Fine-grained tasks create more frequent, smaller traces. Coarse-grained tasks create fewer, larger traces.
- **Evaluation records are marker traces.** They don't change the work product but signal information about its quality, guiding the evolve loop toward better agent configurations.

## 2. Workflow Patterns: What `blocked_by` and `loops_to` Can Express

### 2.1 The Workflow Patterns Catalog

The Workflow Patterns Initiative, established by Wil van der Aalst, Arthur ter Hofstede, Bartek Kiepuszewski, and Alistair Barros, catalogued 43 control-flow patterns that recur across business process modeling systems. The original 2003 paper identified 20; a 2006 revision expanded this to 43. The initiative also catalogued 43 Resource Patterns and 40 Data Patterns.

These patterns provide a precise vocabulary for what any workflow system can and cannot express.

### 2.2 Patterns Natively Supported by `blocked_by`

| Pattern | ID | Workgraph Expression | Example |
|---------|----|---------------------|---------|
| **Sequence** | WCP1 | `B.blocked_by = [A]` | `write-code → review-code` |
| **Parallel Split** | WCP2 | Multiple tasks sharing the same predecessor: `B.blocked_by = [A]`, `C.blocked_by = [A]` | `plan → {implement-frontend, implement-backend}` |
| **Synchronization** (AND-join) | WCP3 | `D.blocked_by = [B, C]` | `{frontend, backend} → integration-test` |
| **Simple Merge** | WCP5 | Single successor of multiple predecessors, where only one fires | `{hotfix, feature} → deploy` (only one path active) |
| **Implicit Termination** | WCP11 | Tasks with no successors simply complete | Leaf tasks in the graph |

These five patterns — the DAG patterns — are the bread and butter of `blocked_by` graphs.

### 2.3 Patterns Added by `loops_to`

| Pattern | ID | Workgraph Expression |
|---------|----|---------------------|
| **Arbitrary Cycles** | WCP10 | `loops_to` edges create back-edges with guards and max iterations |
| **Structured Loop** | WCP21 | `loops_to` with a guard condition (pre-test or post-test) |

### 2.4 Patterns Requiring Coordinator Logic (Idioms)

These patterns cannot be expressed with static edges alone but can be achieved through coordinator behavior or conventions:

| Pattern | ID | Idiom |
|---------|----|-------|
| **Exclusive Choice** | WCP4 | A coordinator task evaluates a condition and creates only the appropriate successor task |
| **Multi-Choice** | WCP6 | A coordinator task selectively creates subsets of successor tasks |
| **Discriminator** | WCP9 | A join task is manually marked ready after the first of N predecessors completes |
| **Multiple Instance (runtime)** | WCP14-15 | The coordinator dynamically creates N task copies at runtime based on data |
| **Deferred Choice** | WCP16 | Multiple tasks created; coordinator cancels the unchosen ones |
| **Cancel Task/Region** | WCP19/25 | `wg abandon <task-id>` — terminal status that unblocks dependents |
| **Milestone** | WCP18 | A task checks the status of a non-predecessor ("is task X done?") before proceeding |

### 2.5 Resource Patterns and the Agency

Beyond control-flow, Van der Aalst's Resource Patterns describe how work is distributed to agents. Several map directly:

| Resource Pattern | Workgraph Equivalent |
|------------------|----------------------|
| **Role-Based Distribution** (WRP2) | Tasks matched to agents by role |
| **Capability-Based Distribution** (WRP8) | Task `skills` matched against role capabilities |
| **Automatic Execution** (WRP11) | `wg service start` — the coordinator auto-assigns and spawns agents |
| **History-Based Distribution** (WRP6) | Evaluation-informed agent selection in auto-assign tasks |
| **Organizational Distribution** (WRP9) | The agency structure (roles, motivations) determines the distribution |

### 2.6 Summary: Expressiveness Hierarchy

```
blocked_by alone:        WCP1-3, WCP5, WCP11 (basic DAG patterns)
+ loops_to:              + WCP10, WCP21 (cycles and structured loops)
+ coordinator logic:     + WCP4, WCP6, WCP9, WCP14-16, WCP18-20, WCP25
+ resource patterns:     + WRP2, WRP6, WRP8, WRP9, WRP11
```

The design principle: **edges express structure; the coordinator expresses policy.**

## 3. Fork-Join, MapReduce, and Scatter-Gather

### 3.1 The Three Parallel Decomposition Patterns

These three patterns represent variations of the same fundamental idea — parallel decomposition with subsequent aggregation — originating from different fields:

| Pattern | Structure | Origin | Key Distinction |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Fork-Join** | A task forks into N subtasks; a join barrier waits for all N to complete | OS/concurrency theory (Conway 1963, Lea 2000) | Strict barrier synchronization. All forks must join. |
| **MapReduce** | A map phase applies a function to each element in parallel; a reduce phase aggregates results | Dean & Ghemawat 2004, functional programming | Data-parallel. Decomposition driven by data partitioning, not task structure. Includes shuffle/sort between map and reduce. |
| **Scatter-Gather** | A request is scattered to N recipients; responses are gathered by an aggregator | Enterprise Integration Patterns (Hohpe & Woolf 2003) | Message-oriented. Recipients may be heterogeneous. Aggregation may accept partial results. |

### 3.2 Fork-Join in Workgraph

Fork-Join is the natural topology of `blocked_by` graphs:

```
           ┌─── worker-1 ───┐
planner ───┼─── worker-2 ───┼─── synthesizer
           └─── worker-3 ───┘
```

```bash
wg add "Plan the work" --id planner
wg add "Worker 1" --id worker-1 --blocked-by planner
wg add "Worker 2" --id worker-2 --blocked-by planner
wg add "Worker 3" --id worker-3 --blocked-by planner
wg add "Synthesize results" --id synthesizer --blocked-by worker-1 worker-2 worker-3
```

This is WCP2 (Parallel Split) composed with WCP3 (Synchronization). It is workgraph's most fundamental parallel pattern. Every fan-out from a single task is a fork; every convergence point with multiple `blocked_by` entries is a join.

### 3.3 MapReduce in Workgraph

MapReduce adds data-parallel semantics to fork-join. In workgraph, this is expressed as:

1. A **planner** task that analyzes input data and produces a decomposition
2. N **map** tasks (one per data partition), each `blocked_by` the planner
3. A **reduce** task that `blocked_by` all map tasks and aggregates results

The coordinator creates the N map tasks dynamically based on the planner's output. The "shuffle" phase is implicit — each reduce task's description specifies which map outputs it consumes.

This is workgraph's most common pattern for parallelizable research, analysis, and implementation tasks.

### 3.4 Scatter-Gather in Workgraph

Scatter-Gather differs from fork-join in two ways: recipients may be heterogeneous (different roles), and the aggregator may not require all responses. In workgraph:

- **Heterogeneous scatter**: Assign different roles to the worker tasks. A security analyst, a performance engineer, and a UX reviewer all examine the same codebase.
- **Partial gather**: The synthesizer task can be unblocked by marking incomplete worker tasks as `Abandoned` (a terminal status). This is an idiom for the Discriminator pattern (WCP9).

### 3.5 Work-Stealing

Doug Lea's Fork/Join framework introduced work-stealing: idle threads steal tasks from busy threads' queues, achieving dynamic load balancing without central scheduling. The workgraph coordinator does something similar — when an agent finishes a task, the coordinator assigns it the next ready task regardless of which "queue" it originated from. The coordinator's `max_agents` parameter is the thread pool size.

## 4. Pipeline and Assembly Line Patterns

### 4.1 The Pipeline Pattern

A pipeline is a serial chain of specialized processing stages:

```
analyst → implementer → reviewer → deployer
```

Each stage transforms inputs into outputs consumed by the next stage. This maps directly to manufacturing and operations concepts:

| Manufacturing Concept | Workgraph Expression |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Assembly line** | A chain of tasks with sequential `blocked_by` edges, each assigned to a different specialized role |
| **Work station** | A role — the specialized capability at each pipeline stage |
| **Work-in-progress (WIP)** | Tasks in `InProgress` status — the items currently being processed |
| **Throughput** | Rate of task completion — how many tasks move through the pipeline per unit time |
| **Bottleneck** | The pipeline stage with the longest average task duration (identifiable from `started_at`/`completed_at` timestamps) |
| **WIP limit** | `max_agents` parameter — limits how many tasks are simultaneously in-progress |

### 4.2 Pipeline vs. Fork-Join

These two patterns are complementary, not competing:

| Dimension | Pipeline | Fork-Join |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Parallelism type** | Task-level (different stages run concurrently on different work items) | Data-level (same operation applied to multiple items simultaneously) |
| **Role assignment** | Different role per stage | Same role for all workers |
| **When to use** | Work requires sequential specialized transformation | Work is decomposable into independent parallel units |
| **Workgraph shape** | Long chain | Wide diamond |

### 4.3 Combined Patterns

Real workflows combine both. A common workgraph pattern:

```
         ┌─── implement-module-1 ───┐
plan ────┼─── implement-module-2 ───┼─── integrate ─── review ─── deploy
         └─── implement-module-3 ───┘
```

The middle is fork-join (parallel implementation); the overall shape is a pipeline (plan → implement → integrate → review → deploy). Each stage can have a different role:

- `plan`: architect role
- `implement-module-*`: implementer role
- `integrate`: implementer role
- `review`: reviewer role
- `deploy`: operator role

This is the Inverse Conway Maneuver in action — the role assignments shape the pipeline stages, which shape the output architecture.

### 4.4 Theory of Constraints

Eliyahu Goldratt's Theory of Constraints (1984) applies directly to pipelines:

1. **Identify** the bottleneck — the pipeline stage with the lowest throughput
2. **Exploit** the bottleneck — ensure it's never idle (keep it fed with ready tasks)
3. **Subordinate** everything else to the bottleneck — upstream stages should not overproduce
4. **Elevate** the bottleneck — add more agents to that role, or split the role into finer-grained specializations
5. **Repeat** — the bottleneck shifts; find the new one

In workgraph terms: if the `reviewer` role is the bottleneck, either assign more agents to that role, or decompose review into sub-roles (security review, code style review, correctness review) that can run in parallel.

## 5. Autopoiesis: The Self-Producing Agency

### 5.1 The Concept

Autopoiesis (from Greek *auto* "self" + *poiesis* "production") was introduced by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela in 1972 to characterize the self-maintaining chemistry of living cells. An autopoietic system is:

> "A network of inter-related component-producing processes such that the components in interaction generate the same network that produced them."

Key properties:

| Property | Definition |
|----------|-----------|
| **Self-production** | The system's processes produce the components that constitute the system |
| **Operational closure** | Internal operations only produce operations of the same type; the system's boundary is maintained from within |
| **Structural coupling** | While operationally closed, the system is coupled to its environment — perturbations trigger internal structural changes, but the environment does not *determine* internal states |
| **Structural determinism** | The system's current structure determines what perturbations it can respond to and how |

### 5.2 Luhmann's Social Systems Theory

Niklas Luhmann (1984) adapted autopoiesis for sociology with a radical move: **social systems are made of communications, not people.** People are in the *environment* of social systems, not their components. A social system is autopoietic because each communication connects to previous communications and stimulates subsequent ones — communications producing communications.

This reframing is strikingly applicable to workgraph: the *system* is the network of task state transitions and evaluations, not the agents themselves. Agents are in the environment of the workgraph system. What matters is the network of communications: "task X is done" triggers "task Y is ready" triggers "agent A starts work" triggers "task Y is in-progress" — communications producing communications.

### 5.3 The Evolve Loop is Autopoietic

The execute→evaluate→evolve→execute cycle maps precisely onto autopoietic self-production:

```
execute (agents produce artifacts)
   ↓
evaluate (artifacts produce evaluation scores)
   ↓
evolve (scores produce new role/motivation definitions)
   ↓
agents formed from new definitions → assigned to future tasks
   ↓
execute (cycle repeats)
```

| Autopoietic Property | Workgraph Manifestation |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Self-production** | The evolve step produces new agent definitions (modified roles, motivations) that are themselves the components that execute the next cycle. The system literally produces the components that produce the system. |
| **Operational closure** | Agents interact only through the task graph. All "communication" is mediated by task state changes. The internal logic (role definitions, motivation constraints, evaluation rubrics) is self-referential. |
| **Structural coupling** | The task graph is coupled to the external codebase/project. Changes in the environment (new bugs, new requirements) perturb the system by adding new tasks, but the system's internal structure determines how it responds. |
| **Cognition** | Maturana and Varela argued that *living is cognition* — the capacity to maintain autopoiesis in a changing environment is a form of knowing. The evaluation system is the agency's cognition — its capacity to sense whether autopoiesis is being maintained (are tasks being completed successfully?) and adapt accordingly. |
| **Temporalization** | Tasks are momentary events. Once completed, they are consumed. The system must continuously produce new tasks (or loop back via `loops_to`) to maintain itself. A workgraph with no open tasks has ceased its autopoiesis. |

### 5.4 Practical Implications

The autopoietic framing suggests several design principles:

1. **The agency is alive only while tasks flow.** An idle agency with no open tasks is a dead system. The `loops_to` mechanism keeps the agency alive by re-activating tasks.
2. **Evolution is not optional — it is survival.** An agency that does not evolve in response to evaluation feedback will become structurally coupled to an environment that has moved on. The evolve step is the autopoietic system's metabolism.
3. **Perturbations enter through tasks, not through agents.** New requirements, bug reports, and changing priorities are perturbations that enter the system as new tasks. The system's response is determined by its current structure (which agents exist, what roles they have, what motivations constrain them).
4. **Self-reference is a feature, not a bug.** The evolve step modifying the very agents that will execute the next cycle is self-referential. This is what makes the system autopoietic. The self-mutation safety guard (evolver cannot modify its own role without human approval) is the autopoietic system's immune response — preventing pathological self-modification.

## 6. Cybernetics and Control Theory

### 6.1 Core Concepts

Cybernetics (from Greek *kybernetes* "steersman") is the study of regulatory systems — feedback loops, circular causality, and the science of control and communication. Founded by Norbert Wiener (1948) and W. Ross Ashby (1956), it provides the mathematical framework for understanding how systems maintain stability in changing environments.

| Concept | Author | Definition |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Negative feedback** | Wiener (1948) | A signal from the output is fed back to the input to reduce deviation from a desired state. The basis of homeostasis. |
| **Positive feedback** | Wiener (1948) | Output amplifies input, producing exponential growth or runaway change. |
| **Law of Requisite Variety** | Ashby (1956) | "Only variety can absorb variety." A regulator must have at least as many states as the system it regulates. |
| **Homeostasis** | Cannon (1932) | A system maintains internal stability through negative feedback, adjusting to external perturbations. |
| **OODA Loop** | Boyd (1976) | Observe→Orient→Decide→Act. Competitive advantage from completing the loop faster. |
| **Double-loop learning** | Argyris & Schön (1978) | Single-loop: adjust actions to reduce error. Double-loop: question the governing variables themselves. |
| **Second-order cybernetics** | von Foerster (1974) | The cybernetics of cybernetics — the observer is part of the system. |

### 6.2 The Coordinator as Cybernetic Regulator

The workgraph coordinator operates a control loop:

```
       ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
       │                                      │
       ▼                                      │
   [Observe]                             [Feedback]
   Poll graph for ready tasks            Evaluation scores
   Check agent status (alive/dead)       Task completion/failure
       │                                      │
       ▼                                      │
   [Orient]                                   │
   Match tasks to agents by capability        │
   Check capacity (max_agents)                │
       │                                      │
       ▼                                      │
   [Decide]                                   │
   Select agent for task (auto-assign)        │
   Priority ordering of ready tasks           │
       │                                      │
       ▼                                      │
   [Act] ─────────────────────────────────────┘
   Spawn agent on task
   Detect/cleanup dead agents
```

This is simultaneously:
- An **OODA loop** (Boyd): Observe the graph state → Orient to available agents and tasks → Decide on assignment → Act by spawning
- A **negative feedback loop** (Wiener): Failed tasks trigger re-assignment or retry, reducing deviation from the goal state (all tasks done)
- A **homeostatic regulator** (Cannon/Ashby): The coordinator maintains steady throughput despite perturbations (agent failures, new tasks added, changing priorities)

### 6.3 Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety

Ashby's Law states: **"Only variety can absorb variety."** A regulator must have at least as many response options as the system has disturbance types. Formally: V(Regulator) ≥ V(Disturbances).

Applied to workgraph quantitatively:

- Let **V** = the number of distinct task types in the graph (identified by required skills, complexity, domain)
- Let **R** = the number of distinct roles in the agency

**Ashby's Law requires R ≥ V** for adequate regulation. If V grows (new kinds of work emerge) and R does not, the system becomes under-regulated — agents will be assigned to tasks they lack the capability for, producing poor results.

The `evolve` mechanism is precisely how the system increases its requisite variety: when evaluations reveal that existing roles cannot handle certain task types, the evolver creates new roles (increasing R) to match the growing variety of disturbances (V).

| Requisite Variety Violation | Symptom in Workgraph | Fix |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|-----|
| Too few roles for task variety | Low evaluation scores on certain task types | `wg evolve --strategy gap-analysis` |
| Too many roles (over-regulation) | Roles with zero task assignments, wasted agency complexity | `wg evolve --strategy retirement` |
| Motivation too restrictive | Tasks that require speed are assigned agents with "never rush" constraints | Tune acceptable/unacceptable tradeoffs |

### 6.4 Single-Loop vs. Double-Loop Learning

| Learning Type | Mechanism | Workgraph Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Single-loop** | Adjust actions within existing framework to reduce error | Evaluations adjust which agent is assigned to which task type. Same roles, same motivations, different assignment. |
| **Double-loop** | Question and modify the framework itself | The `evolve` step modifies roles and motivations themselves. The governing variables change. |

Single-loop: "This agent performed poorly on this task. Assign a different agent next time."
Double-loop: "The role definition itself is wrong. Modify the role's skills and desired outcome."

Argyris and Schön argued that organizations that cannot double-loop learn become rigid and eventually fail. In workgraph, an agency that only re-assigns tasks without evolving its roles and motivations will plateau in performance.

## 7. The Viable System Model

### 7.1 Beer's Five Systems

Stafford Beer's Viable System Model (VSM) describes the organizational structure of any autonomous system capable of surviving in a changing environment. The model is **recursive**: every viable system contains viable systems and is contained within a viable system.

| System | Name | Function | Key Principle |
|--------|------|----------|---------------|
| **S1** | Operations | The parts that *do things*. Multiple S1 units operate semi-autonomously. | Autonomy of operational units |
| **S2** | Coordination | Prevents oscillation and conflict between S1 units. Scheduling, protocols, standards. | Anti-oscillatory damping |
| **S3** | Operational Control | Optimizes the "here and now" across all S1 units. Resource allocation, synergy. | Internal optimization |
| **S3\*** | Audit Channel | Sporadic checks that bypass normal reporting. | Independent verification |
| **S4** | Intelligence | Scans the external environment for threats and opportunities. Models possible futures. | Adaptation, strategic sensing |
| **S5** | Policy / Identity | Defines the organization's identity, purpose, and ground rules. Balances S3 (stability) and S4 (adaptation). | Organizational closure |

The critical homeostatic balance is the **S3-S4 homeostat**: S3 wants stability and optimization of current operations; S4 wants exploration and adaptation. S5 mediates this tension.

### 7.2 Mapping to Workgraph

| VSM System | Workgraph Equivalent |
|------------|----------------------|
| **S1 (Operations)** | **Agents** executing tasks. Each agent (role + motivation) is a semi-autonomous operational unit. |
| **S2 (Coordination)** | **`blocked_by` dependency edges** and **task status transitions**. These protocols prevent agents from clashing — an agent cannot start a task until dependencies are satisfied. The coordinator's scheduling logic is S2. |
| **S3 (Control)** | **The coordinator** (`wg service start`). It allocates agents to tasks, monitors throughput, detects dead agents, and optimizes resource utilization across all S1 units. |
| **S3\* (Audit)** | **Evaluations**. Sporadic, independent assessment of agent performance that bypasses normal task-completion reporting. The evaluation system provides a check that cannot be gamed by the agent reporting its own success. |
| **S4 (Intelligence)** | **The `evolve` mechanism**. It scans performance data (the "environment" of evaluation scores) for patterns and generates adaptations (new roles, modified motivations). Also: any human operator reviewing the graph and adding tasks based on environmental scanning. |
| **S5 (Policy)** | **Motivations** and **project-level configuration** (CLAUDE.md, the root of the task tree). These define the ground rules under which all agents operate — what is acceptable, what is not, what the system's identity and purpose are. |
| **Recursion** | Workgraph's task nesting. A high-level task can contain subtasks, each potentially a mini-viable-system with its own agents and coordination. |

### 7.3 The S3-S4 Balance in Practice

In workgraph, the S3-S4 tension manifests as:

- **S3 pull (stability)**: "Keep using the existing roles and motivations — they're working fine. Optimize assignment. Don't change what isn't broken."
- **S4 pull (adaptation)**: "The task landscape is changing. New types of work need new roles. Evolve the agency."

The human operator is S5, mediating this tension. The evolve mechanism's self-mutation safety guard (requiring human approval for changes to the evolver's own role) is the S5 function enforcing identity preservation.

## 8. The Principal-Agent Problem

### 8.1 The Problem

The principal-agent problem, formalized by Ross (1973) and Jensen & Meckling (1976), arises when a **principal** delegates work to an **agent** who has different interests and more information than the principal.

Two core information asymmetries:

| Problem | Timing | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Adverse selection** | Before delegation | The agent has private information about their capabilities that the principal cannot observe. The principal may select the wrong agent. |
| **Moral hazard** | After delegation | The agent's actions are not fully observable. The agent may cut corners or pursue private objectives. |

Agency costs (Jensen & Meckling 1976) = Monitoring costs + Bonding costs + Residual loss.

### 8.2 Workgraph as an Agency Relationship

This mapping is unusually precise because workgraph literally has primitives called "agents," "evaluations," and "motivations" — the vocabulary of agency theory.

| Agency Theory Concept | Workgraph Equivalent |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Principal** | The human operator who defines the task graph and configures the agency |
| **Agent** | The workgraph agent (role + motivation) — literally named |
| **Delegation** | `wg service start --max-agents N` — the principal delegates work to autonomous agents |
| **Moral hazard** | The agent might produce low-quality output, hallucinate, or take shortcuts not visible from task completion status alone |
| **Adverse selection** | Assigning the wrong role+motivation pairing to a task — the agent lacks the capability, but this is not apparent until after execution |
| **Monitoring costs** | **Evaluations** — the computational cost of assessing agent output quality after every task |
| **Bonding costs** | **Motivations** — the agent is constrained by its motivation document to act in the principal's interest. Acceptable/unacceptable tradeoffs are the bonding contract. |
| **Incentive alignment** | **The evolve mechanism** — agents that perform well have their patterns reinforced; agents that perform poorly are evolved or retired. This is performance-based selection. |
| **Residual loss** | The gap between what the principal would produce and what the agent actually produces. Minimized by iterating evaluate→evolve. |
| **Repeated games** | The evaluation history builds "reputation" that informs future assignment and evolution. Long-term relationships (many tasks by the same agent) build trust (`TrustLevel::Verified`). |
| **Screening** | The coordinator's auto-assign capability-matching: skills on the task matched against skills on the role. |

### 8.3 Mechanism Design Implications

Agency theory suggests specific design principles for workgraph:

1. **Invest in monitoring (evaluations) proportional to risk.** High-stakes tasks deserve more thorough evaluation. Low-stakes tasks can be spot-checked.
2. **Make bonding explicit.** The motivation's `unacceptable_tradeoffs` should list the specific failure modes the principal fears most. "Never skip tests" is a bonding clause.
3. **Align incentives through evolution.** The evolve mechanism should explicitly reward the behaviors the principal values. If correctness matters more than speed, the evaluation rubric should weight correctness heavily (it does — 40% by default).
4. **Screen before delegating.** Auto-assign should match task skills against agent capabilities, not assign randomly. This reduces adverse selection.
5. **Build trust incrementally.** New agents should start with low-stakes tasks. The `TrustLevel` field (Unknown → Provisional → Verified) formalizes this progression.

## 9. Conway's Law and the Inverse Conway Maneuver

### 9.1 Conway's Law

> "Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."
> — Melvin Conway, "How Do Committees Invent?" (1968)

Conway's argument: a system design is decomposed into parts, each assigned to a team. The teams must communicate to integrate the parts. Therefore, the interfaces between the system's parts will mirror the communication channels between the teams. This is a *constraint*, not a choice.

### 9.2 The Inverse Conway Maneuver

Coined by Jonny LeRoy and Matt Simons (2010): if org structure shapes system architecture, then **deliberately designing org structure can drive desired system architecture**. Rather than accepting that your system mirrors your org chart, you restructure teams to produce the architecture you want.

### 9.3 Mapping to Workgraph

| Conway's Law Concept | Workgraph Equivalent |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Organization structure** | The set of roles and how they are assigned to agents |
| **Communication channels** | `blocked_by` edges between tasks assigned to different roles |
| **System architecture** | The task graph structure — how work is decomposed and connected |
| **Conway's constraint** | The task decomposition will mirror the role decomposition. If you have "frontend" and "backend" roles, you get tasks that split along that boundary, producing a system with that split. |
| **Inverse Conway Maneuver** | Deliberately designing roles and motivations to produce the desired task decomposition (and therefore system architecture) |

### 9.4 The Inverse Conway Maneuver in Practice

**Example: Microservices via roles**

If you want a microservices architecture, define one role per service domain:
- `user-service-developer` role
- `payment-service-developer` role
- `notification-service-developer` role

Tasks will naturally be decomposed along service boundaries, and the resulting code will have clean service interfaces — because the dependency edges between tasks assigned to different roles become the API contracts between services.

**Example: Monolith via cross-cutting roles**

If you want a cohesive monolith, define cross-cutting roles:
- `backend-developer` role (handles all backend work)
- `frontend-developer` role (handles all frontend work)

Tasks will be decomposed by layer, not by domain, producing a layered monolith.

The profound implication: **in workgraph, the role ontology IS the org chart, and the task graph IS the system architecture.** Conway's Law predicts they will converge. The Inverse Conway Maneuver says: design the roles first, and the task graph (and resulting code) will follow.

## 10. Team Topologies

### 10.1 The Framework

Team Topologies (Skelton & Pais, 2019) provides a practical framework for organizing technology teams, built on Conway's Law and cognitive load theory.

**Four team types:**

| Team Type | Purpose | Cognitive Load Strategy |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| **Stream-aligned** | Aligned to a single valuable stream of work (product, service, user journey). The primary type — most teams should be this. | Owns and delivers end-to-end; minimizes handoffs |
| **Platform** | Provides internal services that accelerate stream-aligned teams. Treats offerings as products with internal customers. | Reduces cognitive load of other teams by providing self-service capabilities |
| **Enabling** | Specialists who help stream-aligned teams acquire missing capabilities. Cross-cuts multiple teams. | Temporarily increases capability of other teams, then steps back |
| **Complicated-subsystem** | Maintains a part of the system requiring heavy specialist knowledge (ML model, codec, financial engine). | Isolates specialist knowledge so others don't need it |

**Three interaction modes:**

| Mode | Description | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Collaboration** | Two teams work closely together for a defined period (joint exploration). High bandwidth. | Temporary (weeks) |
| **X-as-a-Service** | One team provides, another consumes, with a clear API/contract. Low overhead. | Ongoing (steady-state) |
| **Facilitating** | One team helps and mentors another. One-way knowledge transfer. | Temporary (until capability transferred) |

### 10.2 Mapping to Workgraph Roles

| Team Topologies Concept | Workgraph Equivalent |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Stream-aligned team** | A role assigned to a stream of related tasks. The "default" role type. |
| **Platform team** | A role whose tasks produce shared infrastructure that unblocks other agents' tasks. Platform tasks appear as `blocked_by` dependencies for stream-aligned tasks. |
| **Enabling team** | A role whose tasks improve other roles/agents — writing documentation, creating templates, establishing patterns. Maps naturally to the evolve mechanism. |
| **Complicated-subsystem team** | A role with specialized capabilities, assigned to tasks that other agents should not attempt. |
| **Collaboration mode** | Two agents sharing `blocked_by` edges on overlapping tasks during a discovery phase. |
| **X-as-a-Service mode** | Clean `blocked_by` edges: platform tasks complete, stream-aligned tasks consume their outputs. |
| **Facilitating mode** | An enabling agent's tasks are prerequisites for another agent's improvement. |
| **Cognitive load** | The number and complexity of tasks assigned to a single agent. Overload signals the need for role decomposition. |
| **Team API** | The interface between roles — defined by what outputs one role produces that another role's tasks consume. |

### 10.3 Practical Guidance for Workgraph Users

1. **Most roles should be stream-aligned.** If you have a "build the feature" type of work, that's stream-aligned. Don't over-specialize.
2. **Create platform roles for shared infrastructure.** If multiple stream-aligned agents need the same tooling/setup, create a platform role whose tasks they all depend on.
3. **Use enabling roles sparingly.** An "evolver" that reviews the agency and proposes improvements is an enabling role. It shouldn't exist permanently — it should work itself out of a job.
4. **Complicated-subsystem roles protect cognitive load.** If a task requires deep ML expertise, create a specialized role rather than expecting a general-purpose role to handle it.
5. **Interaction modes evolve.** Two agents might collaborate on initial exploration, then shift to X-as-a-Service once interfaces stabilize. The task graph structure should reflect this evolution.

## 11. Organizational Theory Primitives

### 11.1 Division of Labor

Adam Smith's pin factory (1776): splitting work into specialized steps increases productivity. In workgraph, this maps to:

- **Task decomposition**: Breaking a large task into smaller subtasks, each with a specific focus
- **Role specialization**: Defining roles with narrow skill sets (analyst, implementer, reviewer) rather than one generalist role
- **The pipeline pattern**: Sequential stages of specialized work (Section 4)

The tradeoff: over-specialization increases coordination costs (more `blocked_by` edges, more handoffs, more potential for misalignment). This is the fundamental tension in organizational design, and it applies directly to workgraph agency design.

### 11.2 Span of Control

The number of subordinates a manager can effectively supervise. In workgraph: the number of agents a single coordinator tick can effectively manage. The `max_agents` parameter is the span of control.

Research suggests 5-9 direct reports as optimal for human managers (Urwick, 1956). For workgraph, the constraint is computational: how many agents can the coordinator monitor, evaluate, and evolve without losing oversight quality.

### 11.3 Coordination Costs

Every dependency edge (`blocked_by`) is a coordination point. The total coordination cost of a task graph scales with the number of edges, not the number of tasks. This connects to Brooks's Law: "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later" — because the number of communication channels grows as n(n-1)/2 with n participants.

In workgraph terms: adding more agents (higher `max_agents`) only helps if the task graph has enough parallelism to exploit. If the graph is a serial chain, more agents are wasted. If the graph is a wide diamond (fork-join), more agents directly increase throughput — up to the point where coordination overhead dominates.

### 11.4 Transaction Cost Economics

Oliver Williamson's Transaction Cost Economics (1975, 1985) asks: when should work be done inside the organization ("make") vs. outside ("buy")? The answer depends on:

| Factor | Favors "Make" (Internal) | Favors "Buy" (External) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Asset specificity** | High (specialized knowledge needed) | Low (commodity work) |
| **Uncertainty** | High (requirements change frequently) | Low (well-defined) |
| **Frequency** | High (recurring work) | Low (one-off) |

In workgraph, this maps to the choice between:
- **Internal agents** (agency-defined roles with specialized capabilities) for recurring, high-specificity work
- **External agents** (human operators, one-off shell executors) for infrequent, well-defined tasks

The `executor` field on agents (`claude`, `matrix`, `email`, `shell`) represents this make-vs-buy boundary.

## 12. Synthesis: Cross-Cutting Connections

These frameworks are not independent — they are deeply interconnected views of the same underlying organizational dynamics.

### 12.2 Key Structural Identities

Several deep identities connect these frameworks:

1. **VSM + Cybernetics + OODA**: Beer's VSM is explicitly cybernetic. S3 is a negative feedback regulator; S4 is the Observe/Orient function; S5 is the governing variable for double-loop learning. The coordinator's OODA loop IS the S3 regulation cycle.

2. **Stigmergy + Autopoiesis**: Both describe systems that maintain themselves without central control. Stigmergy is the *mechanism* (indirect coordination through traces); autopoiesis is the *property* (self-production). A stigmergic system that produces its own traces is autopoietic.

3. **Conway's Law + Team Topologies + Resource Patterns**: Conway's Law is the theoretical prediction; Team Topologies is the practical prescription; Workflow Resource Patterns are the formal specification. All three say: *how you assign people to work determines the structure of what gets built.*

4. **Principal-Agent + Evaluations + Cybernetics**: Agency theory identifies the *problem* (misaligned incentives under information asymmetry); cybernetics provides the *solution architecture* (feedback loops); evaluations are the *implementation* of both monitoring (agency theory) and negative feedback (cybernetics).

5. **Fork-Join + Workflow Patterns + `blocked_by`**: Fork-Join is the computational realization of WCP2+WCP3, which are the two most fundamental `blocked_by` graph topologies.

6. **Autopoiesis + Evolve + Double-Loop Learning**: The execute→evaluate→evolve→execute cycle is simultaneously autopoietic (self-producing), double-loop (questioning governing variables), and cybernetic (feedback-driven regulation). This is the single most theoretically dense primitive in workgraph.

## 13. Practical Recommendations

### 13.1 Agency Design Checklist

Based on the theoretical frameworks above, here is a checklist for designing a workgraph agency:

| Step | Framework | Question | Action |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Conway's Law | What system architecture do I want? | Design roles to mirror the desired decomposition |
| 2 | Requisite Variety | Do I have enough roles for the variety of tasks? | Count task types, ensure ≥1 role per type |
| 3 | Team Topologies | Which role is stream-aligned? Platform? Enabling? | Label roles by type; most should be stream-aligned |
| 4 | Division of Labor | How fine-grained should specialization be? | Balance specialization against coordination cost |
| 5 | Principal-Agent | What failure modes do I fear most? | Encode them in motivations as `unacceptable_tradeoffs` |
| 6 | Cybernetics | Is the feedback loop working? | Enable auto-evaluate; run evolve periodically |
| 7 | VSM S3-S4 | Am I balancing stability and adaptation? | Don't evolve too often (S3) or too rarely (S4) |

### 13.2 Pattern Selection Guide

| Situation | Pattern | Workgraph Expression |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Sequential specialized stages | Pipeline (Section 4) | Serial `blocked_by` chain, different roles per stage |
| Independent parallelizable work | Fork-Join (Section 3) | Fan-out from planner, fan-in to synthesizer |
| Data-parallel analysis | MapReduce (Section 3) | Planner decomposes → N workers → reducer aggregates |
| Heterogeneous parallel review | Scatter-Gather (Section 3) | Multiple reviewer roles examine same artifact |
| Iterative refinement | Structured Loop (Section 2) | `loops_to` with guard and max_iterations |
| Recurring process | Autopoietic cycle (Section 5) | `loops_to` chain forming a full cycle |

### 13.3 Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Theory Violated | Symptom | Fix |
|--------------|----------------|---------|-----|
| One role for all tasks | Requisite Variety | Low scores on specialized tasks | Add specialized roles |
| Too many roles | Parsimony / coordination cost | Roles with zero tasks; confusion in assignment | Retire unused roles |
| No evaluations | Agency Theory (no monitoring) | Quality drift; no evolution signal | Enable auto-evaluate |
| Evolving every cycle | VSM S3-S4 imbalance | Instability; roles changing faster than agents can adapt | Evolve periodically, not continuously |
| Serial pipeline where fork-join fits | Division of Labor mismatch | Slow throughput on parallelizable work | Decompose into parallel tasks |
| Monolithic tasks | No division of labor | Single agent bottleneck; no parallelism | Break into subtasks with dependencies |
| Circular `blocked_by` without `loops_to` | Workflow Patterns (unbounded cycle) | Deadlock or infinite loop | Use `loops_to` with guards and max_iterations |
