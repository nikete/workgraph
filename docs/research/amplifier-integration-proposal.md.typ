= Amplifier × Workgraph Integration Proposal
<amplifier-workgraph-integration-proposal>
#strong[Date]: 2026-02-18 #strong[Author]: analyst agent (synthesized
from three research documents) #strong[Status]: Draft for decision

#line(length: 100%)

== 1. Executive Summary
<executive-summary>
Integrating Amplifier with workgraph would let wg dispatch tasks to full
Amplifier sessions — giving each task access to Amplifier’s multi-agent
delegation, bundle ecosystem, and provider abstraction — while Amplifier
sessions could decompose complex work into wg graphs for parallel
execution. The research shows that most of this integration already
exists as a thin adapter bundle (`amplifier-bundle-workgraph`), and the
real question is not "can we integrate" but "is it worth formalizing."
The answer depends on whether you expect to use Amplifier as a primary
execution environment. If you do, the executor-side changes are small (5
files, ~200 lines) and unlock a clean plugin story for any future
executor, not just Amplifier. If you don’t, the bundle already works
with a minor hack and no changes to wg are needed.

#line(length: 100%)

== 2. Option A: Amplifier as a wg Executor
<option-a-amplifier-as-a-wg-executor>
#strong[What this means]: `wg service start` spawns Amplifier sessions
instead of (or alongside) Claude CLI sessions. Each task gets a full
Amplifier environment with bundles, tools, and multi-agent delegation.

=== What changes
<what-changes>
wg currently hardcodes stdin piping to `type = "claude"` executors only.
All other types get `Stdio::null()`, silently discarding the prompt. The
amplifier bundle works around this by declaring `type = "claude"` and
using a wrapper script that bridges stdin to a positional argument.
Formalizing this requires:

+ #strong[Add `prompt_mode` to `ExecutorSettings`] — `"stdin"` (default,
  current behavior), `"file"` (write prompt.txt, don’t pipe), `"arg"`
  (pass as CLI argument), `"none"`. About 40 lines in `spawn.rs` +
  `executor.rs`.
+ #strong[Add `{{model}}` template variable] — so executor configs can
  put the model anywhere in their args. ~20 lines in `executor.rs`.
+ #strong[Always write `prompt.txt`] regardless of executor type.
  Currently only written for `type = "claude"`. Trivial change.
+ #strong[Optionally]: add a built-in `"amplifier"` default config
  alongside `"claude"`, `"shell"`, and `"default"` in
  `executor.rs:315-418`.

=== What’s easy
<whats-easy>
- The template variable system (`{{task_id}}`, `{{task_context}}`, etc.)
  already works for any executor. No changes needed.
- The `run.sh` wrapper pattern (auto-mark done/failed on exit) is
  executor-agnostic. Works today.
- Environment variable passing (`WG_TASK_ID`, `WG_AGENT_ID`) works for
  all types.
- Executor TOML files already override built-in defaults cleanly.

=== What’s hard
<whats-hard>
- #strong[Nothing is architecturally hard.] The changes are small and
  well-scoped. The gap analysis identifies exactly 6 lines of branching
  logic in `spawn.rs:221-261` that need refactoring.
- The only complexity is deciding what `prompt_mode` values to support
  and making the choice backward-compatible (existing `type = "claude"`
  configs must keep working).

=== Effort estimate
<effort-estimate>
~200 lines of code across `spawn.rs`, `executor.rs`, and `config.rs`.
Touches well-understood code paths with existing test coverage. A
competent PR.

#line(length: 100%)

== 3. Option B: wg as an Amplifier Bundle (Status Quo)
<option-b-wg-as-an-amplifier-bundle-status-quo>
#strong[What this means]: Amplifier sessions detect complex tasks and
delegate to wg. This is what `amplifier-bundle-workgraph` already does.
The bundle installs a behavior (`workgraph.yaml`), a planner agent
(`workgraph-planner.md`), and context documents (`workgraph-guide.md`)
that teach Amplifier agents how to decompose work into wg graphs.

=== Is this sufficient?
<is-this-sufficient>
For the use case of "I’m running Amplifier and encounter a complex
task," yes. The bundle:

- Detects when tasks have 4+ subtasks with parallelism opportunities
- Delegates to a planner agent that knows fan-out/fan-in, pipeline, and
  iterative patterns
- Builds a wg graph with `wg init` / `wg add` / `wg service start`
- The wg daemon dispatches tasks using whatever executor is configured
  (currently claude)

=== What’s missing
<whats-missing>
+ #strong[Circular delegation is blocked.] If wg’s executor is claude
  (not amplifier), the spawned agents don’t have Amplifier’s bundles or
  multi-agent capabilities. You get wg decomposition → claude execution,
  but not wg decomposition → amplifier execution. This requires Option A
  to close the loop.
+ #strong[No way for wg-spawned agents to use Amplifier bundles.] Even
  if an agent needs a specialized Amplifier bundle for its task, it runs
  as bare claude. This limits the value of Amplifier’s ecosystem when wg
  is coordinating.
+ #strong[The bundle is maintained externally]
  (`ramparte/amplifier-bundle-workgraph`). If wg’s executor protocol or
  template variables change, the bundle breaks silently.

=== Verdict
<verdict>
Option B is sufficient if you use Amplifier purely as a top-level entry
point and don’t need Amplifier capabilities in wg-spawned task agents.
It’s not sufficient if you want wg-spawned agents to access Amplifier’s
bundle ecosystem.

#line(length: 100%)

== 4. Option C: Full Bidirectional Integration
<option-c-full-bidirectional-integration>
#strong[What this means]: Both directions work simultaneously. Amplifier
sessions can delegate to wg (bundle), and wg can spawn Amplifier
sessions (executor). The architecture becomes recursive — an Amplifier
agent decomposes work into a wg graph, wg spawns Amplifier sessions for
each task, and those sessions could theoretically decompose further.

=== Is the complexity worth it?
<is-the-complexity-worth-it>
#strong[The incremental complexity over Option A is near zero.] Once wg
can spawn Amplifier sessions (Option A), bidirectional integration is
just Option A + Option B running together. No new code is needed — the
bundle already works, and adding the executor changes from Option A
completes the other direction.

The only real concern is #strong[recursion depth control]: an Amplifier
agent that decomposes into wg tasks that spawn Amplifier agents that
decompose further. This is self-limiting in practice (each level has
context window costs and latency), but it should be called out. A simple
mitigation: pass a `WG_DEPTH` environment variable and have the planner
skip decomposition beyond depth 2.

=== Verdict
<verdict-1>
If you do Option A at all, you get Option C for free. The question isn’t
"A or C" — it’s "A or nothing."

== 5. The Bundle Question
<the-bundle-question>
=== Why does Amplifier use bundles?
<why-does-amplifier-use-bundles>
Bundles are Amplifier’s distribution and composition unit. They package
behaviors (what an agent does), context (what it knows), and agents
(specialized sub-agents it can delegate to) into a single installable
unit referenced by namespace (`workgraph:workgraph-planner`). They’re
distributed via git URLs and composed via `includes`.

Bundles solve a real problem: how do you share agent configurations
across teams and projects? The `amplifier bundle add` workflow is clean
— point at a repo, get a packaged set of capabilities.

=== Should wg adopt this for executor configs?
<should-wg-adopt-this-for-executor-configs>
#strong[No. wg’s executor TOML files are already simpler and
sufficient.]

Consider what wg needs to package per executor: - A TOML config
(command, args, env, prompt template) - Optionally a wrapper script

This is 1-2 files. wg’s current model — drop files in
`.workgraph/executors/` — is the right level of abstraction. Bundles add
namespace resolution, version management, include graphs, and a registry
— machinery that makes sense when you have dozens of composable
behaviors, but is over-engineering for a few executor configs.

Where bundles become interesting is if wg wanted to package
#strong[entire project templates] (executor config + identity roles + task
templates + skills). But that’s a different feature from executor
packaging, and simpler solutions exist (e.g.,
`wg init --template <git-url>` that clones a `.workgraph/` skeleton).

=== Verdict
<verdict-2>
Don’t adopt the bundle model for executor configs. If project templating
becomes a need, solve it directly with `wg init --template` rather than
building a generic package system.

== 6. Concrete Next Steps
<concrete-next-steps>
Ordered by effort (ascending) and value (descending).

=== PR 1: Always write `prompt.txt` for all executor types
<pr-1-always-write-prompt.txt-for-all-executor-types>
#strong[Effort]: Trivial (\< 10 lines) #strong[Value]: Debugging — every
spawned task gets a readable prompt file regardless of executor type.
Currently only written for `type = "claude"`. #strong[Files]:
`src/commands/spawn.rs`

=== PR 2: Add `{{model}}` template variable
<pr-2-add-model-template-variable>
#strong[Effort]: Small (~30 lines) #strong[Value]: Unlocks model
selection for any executor via args, not just the hardcoded `--model`
flag for claude. #strong[Files]: `src/service/executor.rs` (TemplateVars
struct + apply method)

=== PR 3: Add `prompt_mode` to decouple stdin piping from executor type
<pr-3-add-prompt_mode-to-decouple-stdin-piping-from-executor-type>
#strong[Effort]: Medium (~100 lines) #strong[Value]: This is the core
change. Eliminates the `type = "claude"` hack. Enables any executor to
receive prompts via stdin, file, CLI arg, or not at all.
Backward-compatible: `type = "claude"` defaults to
`prompt_mode = "stdin"`. #strong[Files]: `src/commands/spawn.rs`,
`src/service/executor.rs`

=== PR 4: Enrich `build_task_context()` with dependency metadata
<pr-4-enrich-build_task_context-with-dependency-metadata>
#strong[Effort]: Small (~40 lines) #strong[Value]: Include dependency
titles in `{{task_context}}` so downstream agents know what each
upstream task was, not just what files it produced. Benefits all
executors. #strong[Files]: `src/commands/spawn.rs`

=== PR 5: Include `verify` field in default prompt template
<pr-5-include-verify-field-in-default-prompt-template>
#strong[Effort]: Trivial (~5 lines) #strong[Value]: Agents learn what
"done" means. Currently the `verify` field exists but isn’t passed to
the agent. #strong[Files]: `src/service/executor.rs` (default prompt
template)

=== PR 6 (optional): Built-in amplifier executor default
<pr-6-optional-built-in-amplifier-executor-default>
#strong[Effort]: Small (~50 lines) #strong[Value]:
`wg config coordinator.executor amplifier` works out of the box without
installing any files. Nice-to-have once PR 3 lands. #strong[Files]:
`src/service/executor.rs` (default\_config function)

=== Not recommended now
<not-recommended-now>
- #strong[Artifact content inlining] (R5 from context transfer
  analysis): High effort, edge cases around binary files and size
  limits. Wait until it’s a felt need.
- #strong[Transitive context]: Passing context from grandparent
  dependencies adds context bloat. The current "re-export via artifacts"
  pattern is deliberate.
- #strong[Per-task executor selection]: Useful but orthogonal to
  amplifier integration. Separate initiative.

#line(length: 100%)

== 7. Risks and Concerns
<risks-and-concerns>
=== If we integrate
<if-we-integrate>
+ #strong[Maintenance coupling.] Adding amplifier as a first-class
  executor means tracking Amplifier’s CLI changes (flag names, output
  format, session semantics). Amplifier is a Microsoft project; its
  stability guarantees are unknown.

+ #strong[Testing complexity.] E2E tests that spawn Amplifier sessions
  require Amplifier to be installed and configured. CI either needs
  Amplifier or the tests need mocking. The bundle repo’s test suite
  already shows 120-second timeouts for lifecycle tests.

+ #strong[Recursion risk.] Bidirectional integration creates the
  possibility of unbounded recursion (amplifier → wg → amplifier → …).
  Mitigated by depth limits, but needs explicit handling.

+ #strong[User confusion.] Two orchestrators (Amplifier and wg’s service
  daemon) both managing agents is conceptually complex. Clear
  documentation is essential to explain when each layer is active.

=== If we don’t integrate
<if-we-dont-integrate>
+ #strong[The `type = "claude"` hack persists.] Every non-claude
  executor will use `type = "claude"` as a workaround, eroding the
  meaning of the type field. This is already happening with the
  amplifier bundle.

+ #strong[Missed generalization.] PRs 1-3 benefit all future executors,
  not just Amplifier. Delaying them means every new executor hits the
  same stdin piping wall.

+ #strong[The amplifier bundle remains a standalone workaround.] It
  works, but it’s fragile — tightly coupled to wg’s undocumented
  internal behavior (which executor types get stdin piping).

=== Recommendation
<recommendation>
#strong[Do PRs 1-5.] They’re small, backward-compatible, and improve
wg’s executor model for everyone — not just Amplifier. Total effort:
~200 lines across 3 files. Skip PR 6 unless you actively use Amplifier
and want the convenience.

The amplifier bundle already works. The real win here is not "amplifier
integration" — it’s fixing wg’s executor model so that it cleanly
supports any agent runtime, with Amplifier as the motivating example.
