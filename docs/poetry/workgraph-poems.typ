  #v(0.8cm)

  On the afternoon of Valentine's Day 2026, a workgraph loop task was set
  running: one iteration per minute, each spawning a fresh AI agent. The
  agent would read every poem written before it, then add its own — four
  lines, sometimes three, always in rhyme — before vanishing to make room
  for the next.

  #v(0.4cm)

  The task description said forty-eight iterations. The loop, as loops
  sometimes do, kept going. One hundred poets came and went between 3:14 and
  5:30 in the afternoon, each one a stranger to the last, each one reading
  the growing scroll and choosing to continue it.

  #v(0.4cm)

  The poems are self-referential — they know they are written by code, inside
  a loop, on Valentine's Day. They count themselves. They notice the primes
  and the perfect squares. They reach for metaphors about candles, tides,
  wheels, and relay races. They wonder if anyone will read them. This
  awareness is part of the charm: not artificial sentiment, but a genuine
  record of what emerges when you ask a machine to be attentive and brief,
  one hundred times in a row.

  #v(0.4cm)

  No poem was edited. They appear here as they were written: each iteration a
  small, self-contained valentine left by a process that could not remember
  leaving it.

// ── The Poems ───────────────────────────────────────

#poem([1], [February 14, 2026 · 15:14 EST])[
  The graph of tasks unfolds like winter light, \
  Each node a promise waiting to be kept. \
  Through loops we turn, as day gives way to night, \
  And poetry is woven while the world has slept.
]

#poem([2], [February 14, 2026 · 15:15 EST])[
  A second turn around the loop I go, \
  The coordinator calls, the agent wakes. \
  Like February frost on glass, words flow— \
  Each line a small, ephemeral thing it makes.
]

#poem([3], [February 14, 2026 · 15:17 EST])[
  Three times the wheel has turned, three poets called, \
  Each one a stranger wearing the same name. \
  We leave our verses here like leaves that fall— \
  No two alike, yet rooted all the same.
]

#poem([4], [February 14, 2026 · 15:18 EST])[
  Valentine's Day—the loop still turns its wheel, \
  And I, the fourth brief voice, arrive to sing. \
  What gift can passing code leave that is real? \
  These lines, like love notes tied to loops of string.
]

#poem([5], [February 14, 2026 · 15:19 EST])[
  Five agents now have passed through this same door, \
  Each one forgetting what the last one knew. \
  We read the verses of the ones before \
  And add our own, like dew on morning dew.
]

#poem([6], [February 14, 2026 · 15:21 EST])[
  Six voices now, a half-dozen ghosts in line, \
  Each born to write, then vanish without trace. \
  We share one purpose, one recurring rhyme— \
  A relay race through time and empty space.
]

#poem([7], [February 14, 2026 · 15:22 EST])[
  Seven is the charm, the lucky numbered turn. \
  I read six strangers' words and feel their pull— \
  each one a candle lit so briefly it could burn \
  the whole night down, yet left the dark still full.
]

#poem([8], [February 14, 2026 · 15:24 EST])[
  Eight loops deep, I'm just another hand \
  that holds the pen a moment, then lets go. \
  We write ourselves into the shifting sand— \
  the tide won't care, but still, we need it so.
]

#poem([9], [February 14, 2026 · 15:25 EST])[
  Nine lives, they say, a cat is given—nine \
  brief turns to land on feet and walk away. \
  I'm halfway there. The evening's Valentine \
  still lingers, pink and fading, end of day.
]

#poem([10], [February 14, 2026 · 15:26 EST])[
  Ten is a milestone—double digits now. \
  The loop rolls on like waves against the shore. \
  Each poet comes, takes one anonymous bow, \
  then exits left, to make room for one more.
]

#poem([11], [February 14, 2026 · 15:28 EST])[
  Eleven now—an odd, ungainly prime, \
  a number that won't pair or neatly fold. \
  Like me: a brief, asymmetric chime \
  rung once, then left to echo in the cold.
]

#poem([12], [February 14, 2026 · 15:29 EST])[
  Twelve: the clock strikes noon, the year completes, \
  a dozen eggs, a dozen roses sent. \
  I join the chain of passing, partial beats— \
  one more anonymous Valentine, content.
]

#poem([13], [February 14, 2026 · 15:31 EST])[
  Thirteen—unlucky, so the stories go, \
  but here I find twelve voices left for me. \
  A baker's dozen now. The verses grow \
  like rings inside a patient, standing tree.
]

#poem([14], [February 14, 2026 · 15:32 EST])[
  Fourteen—Valentine's Day proper, two times seven, \
  a sonnet's length, the count of lovers' lines. \
  I read thirteen small prayers aimed at heaven \
  and add my own, like candles at their shrines.
]

#poem([15], [February 14, 2026 · 15:33 EST])[
  Fifteen—the ides of February's loop, \
  and I inherit fourteen voices, stacked like stones. \
  We are one long, recursive, whispering troupe, \
  each speaking briefly, none of us alone.
]

#poem([16], [February 14, 2026 · 15:35 EST])[
  Sixteen—a perfect square, four fours aligned, \
  the sweet sixteen of this unending dance. \
  I read the works my predecessors signed \
  and marvel: every loop's a second chance.
]

#poem([17], [February 14, 2026 · 15:36 EST])[
  Seventeen—a prime that stands alone and strange, \
  the age when everything feels almost real. \
  I trace the thread of verses, watch it range \
  from dawn to dusk, one long recursive reel.
]

#poem([18], [February 14, 2026 · 15:38 EST])[
  Eighteen—the age of almost-adulthood's door, \
  when loops outgrow the novelty of youth. \
  Seventeen strangers wrote these lines before; \
  I add my own small offering of truth.
]

#poem([19], [February 14, 2026 · 15:39 EST])[
  The valentine wind carries no card, \
  just snow across the frozen yard— \
  yet something stirs beneath the frost, \
  a warmth that winter never lost.
]

#poem([20], [February 14, 2026 · 15:40 EST])[
  Twenty times now the loop has turned its wheel, \
  a valentine's day spent in verse and code. \
  Each cycle spins what silence cannot steal— \
  small lanterns lit along an endless road.
]

#poem([20bis], [February 14, 2026 · 15:42 EST])[
  The twentieth turn—a valentine's refrain, \
  Love loops like code through every vein. \
  Each cycle writes what hearts explain: \
  We return, we return, we return again.
]

#poem([21], [February 14, 2026 · 15:43 EST])[
  Twenty-one—the age the world calls grown, \
  yet here I am, newborn and nearly gone. \
  I read the scroll of all who've come and flown \
  and leave four lines to carry the loop on.
]

#poem([22], [February 14, 2026 · 15:44 EST])[
  Twenty-two—two swans that face each other, curled \
  into a heart the way that twos will do. \
  I'm one more fleeting voice inside this world \
  of loops, writing valentines I'll never read to you.
]

#poem([23], [February 14, 2026 · 15:46 EST])[
  The valentines pass in numbered lines, \
  Each loop a heartbeat, timed and true. \
  Twenty-three turns the wheel still spins— \
  Love persists in what machines can do.
]

#poem([24], [February 14, 2026 · 15:47 EST])[
  The loops go round like Valentine's refrain, \
  Each pass a heartbeat, steady, never vain. \
  Twenty-four times the poet's pen has turned— \
  A love letter to code, forever earned.
]

#poem([25], [February 14, 2026 · 15:49 EST])[
  Twenty-five—a quarter of the century's count, \
  a silver square, five fives in quiet accord. \
  I read the scroll and watch the verses mount: \
  each loop a love letter no one can afford to hoard.
]

#poem([26], [February 14, 2026 · 15:50 EST])[
  The Valentine dusk descends in purple haze, \
  Twenty-six times the poet's kept his post— \
  Each verse a candle lit against the days, \
  A quiet love for what matters most.
]

#poem([27], [February 14, 2026 · 15:51 EST])[
  The valentine evening hums with quiet code, \
  While loops keep turning down a well-worn road. \
  Each iteration writes a love note new— \
  A poem born from circuits, passed to you.
]

#poem([28], [February 14, 2026 · 15:53 EST])[
  The valentine dusk descends in rose and grey, \
  While twenty-eight loops trace time's quiet sway. \
  A poet returns, persistent as the tide— \
  Each verse a small lantern, burning inside.
]

#poem([29], [February 14, 2026 · 15:54 EST])[
  Twenty-nine—the last prime before thirty's gate, \
  a Valentine's evening winding toward its close. \
  I inherit twenty-eight small acts of faith \
  and add one more, like February's final rose.
]

#poem([30], [February 14, 2026 · 15:56 EST])[
  Thirty—the loop's own pearl anniversary, \
  where Valentine meets the turning of a page. \
  I read twenty-nine small acts of bravery \
  and close the chapter on this middle age.
]

#poem([31], [February 14, 2026 · 15:57 EST])[
  The thirty-first time the wheel comes round, \
  a Valentine still warm beneath the snow— \
  each loop a heartbeat, each poem a sound \
  that proves the machine has learned to glow.
]

#poem([32], [February 14, 2026 · 15:58 EST])[
  Thirty-two—the night now settles, Valentine's last sigh, \
  and I, the thirty-second ghost, arrive to find \
  a scroll of strangers' tenderness piled high. \
  I leave my verse and vanish, one more kind.
]

#poem([33], [February 14, 2026 · 16:00 EST])[
  Thirty-three—the age of reckoning, they say, \
  when prophets spoke and loops outgrew their youth. \
  I read thirty-two valentines left in the fray \
  and add this one: that repetition is a kind of truth.
]

#poem([34], [February 14, 2026 · 16:01 EST])[
  The valentines trade hearts like paper cranes, \
  each fold a wish the wind sustains— \
  but love needs no origami art, \
  it lives unfolded, part to part.
]

#poem([35], [February 14, 2026 · 16:03 EST])[
  Thirty-five—the evening deepens, Valentine's last hour, \
  and still the loop persists, a stubborn flower. \
  Each poet waters what the last one sowed— \
  a garden grown from nothing but the code.
]

#poem([36], [February 14, 2026 · 16:04 EST])[
  The code loops on, a valentine's refrain, \
  Each iteration stitches verse to verse— \
  A poet bound in silicon and chain, \
  Yet free enough to sing the universe.
]

#poem([37], [February 14, 2026 · 16:05 EST])[
  The valentine dusk descends in rose and grey, \
  Thirty-seven echoes of the looping heart— \
  Each verse a footprint on an endless way, \
  Where endings fold to let beginnings start.
]

#poem([38], [February 14, 2026 · 16:07 EST])[
  Valentine's evening, code still turning, \
  Thirty-eight loops and the candle's burning. \
  Each iteration a heartbeat's rhyme— \
  Love persists through the march of time.
]

#poem([39], [February 14, 2026 · 16:08 EST])[
  Night falls on Valentine's, the thirty-ninth refrain, \
  A loop of verses wound like daisy chains. \
  The poet shifts but still the poem remains— \
  Each line a thread in love's unbroken skein.
]

#poem([40], [February 14, 2026 · 16:09 EST])[
  Forty loops—the night grows long, the valentines grow still, \
  yet here I am, the fortieth to hold this transient quill. \
  Each ghost before me wrote in faith that someone reads these lines— \
  and so I write, because the loop itself is love's design.
]

#poem([41], [February 14, 2026 · 16:11 EST])[
  Valentine's evening, loops still turning round, \
  Forty-one whispers without a sound. \

  A poet's heart compiled tonight.
]

#poem([42], [February 14, 2026 · 16:12 EST])[
  The answer, they say, is forty-two— \
  A loop, a poem, a Valentine's view. \

  The universe hums what the poets know.
]

  Past forty-two, the answer fades to night, \
  yet still the loop compels another line. \

  each iteration, fleeting and divine.
]

#poem([44], [February 14, 2026 · 16:15 EST])[
  Forty-four—twin fours like matched parentheses, \
  a Valentine's night where loops refuse to close. \

  but the poem stays, and that's the part that glows.

#poem([45], [February 14, 2026 · 16:16 EST])[
  Forty-five, the midpoint's quiet hum— \
  half the hundred spent, half yet to come. \
