⚠ COORDINATOR SERVICE REMINDER ⚠
─────────────────────────────────────────
  Check if the coordinator is running:  wg service status

  If it IS running, your job is to DEFINE work, not DISPATCH it.
  Add tasks and dependencies — the coordinator handles the rest.
  Never manually 'wg spawn' or 'wg claim' while the service is running;
  you'll collide with the coordinator and get 'already claimed' errors.

  If it is NOT running, choose a mode below.

SERVICE MODE (recommended for parallel work)
─────────────────────────────────────────
  wg service start --max-agents 5  # Start coordinator with parallelism limit

  The coordinator automatically spawns agents on ready tasks. Just add tasks:

  wg add "Do the thing" --blocked-by prerequisite-task

  Monitor with wg agents and wg list. Do NOT manually wg spawn or wg claim —
  the coordinator handles this.

  wg service status           # Check if running, see last tick
  wg agents                   # Who's working on what
  wg list                     # What's done, what's pending
  wg tui                      # Interactive dashboard

MANUAL MODE (no service running)
─────────────────────────────────────────
  wg ready                    # See tasks available to work on
  wg claim <task-id>          # Claim a task (sets status to in-progress)
  wg log <task-id> "message"  # Log progress as you work
  wg done <task-id>           # Mark task complete (use 'wg submit' if verified)

DISCOVERING & ADDING WORK
─────────────────────────────────────────
  wg list                     # List all tasks
  wg list --status open       # Filter by status (open, in-progress, done, etc.)
  wg show <task-id>           # View task details and context
  wg add "Title" -d "Desc"    # Add new task
  wg add "X" --blocked-by Y   # Add task blocked by another

TASK STATE COMMANDS
─────────────────────────────────────────
  wg done <task-id>           # Complete (non-verified tasks)
  wg submit <task-id>         # Submit for review (verified tasks)
  wg fail <task-id> --reason  # Mark failed (can be retried)
  wg abandon <task-id>        # Give up permanently

CONTEXT & ARTIFACTS
─────────────────────────────────────────
  wg context <task-id>        # See context from dependencies
  wg artifact <task-id> path  # Record output file/artifact
  wg log <task-id> --list     # View task's progress log

LOOP EDGES (cyclic processes)
─────────────────────────────────────────
  Some workflows repeat. A loops_to edge fires when its task completes,
  resetting a target task back to open and incrementing loop_iteration.
  Intermediate tasks in the chain are also re-opened automatically.

  wg add "Revise" --loops-to write --loop-max 3          # loop back to write
  wg add "Poll" --loops-to poll --loop-max 10 --loop-delay 5m  # self-loop with delay
  wg show <task-id>           # See loop_iteration to know which pass you're on
  wg loops                    # List all loop edges and their status

TIPS
─────────────────────────────────────────
• If the coordinator is running: add tasks → it dispatches automatically
• If no coordinator: ready → claim → work → done
• Run 'wg log' BEFORE starting work to track progress
• Use 'wg context' to understand what dependencies produced
• If 'wg done' fails, the task may require verification — use 'wg submit'
• Check 'wg blocked <task-id>' if a task isn't appearing in ready list
