# Workgraph

Use workgraph for task management. Run `wg quickstart` for a quick command reference.

## Development

The global `wg` command is installed via `cargo install`. After making changes to the code, run:

```
cargo install --path .
```

to update the global binary. Forgetting this step is a common source of "why isn't this working" issues when testing changes.
