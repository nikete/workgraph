# Workgraph

Use workgraph for task management.

**At the start of each session, run `wg quickstart` in your terminal to orient yourself.**
Use `wg service start` to dispatch work — do not manually claim tasks.

## Development

The global `wg` command is installed via `cargo install`. After making changes to the code, run:

```
cargo install --path .
```

to update the global binary. Forgetting this step is a common source of "why isn't this working" issues when testing changes.
